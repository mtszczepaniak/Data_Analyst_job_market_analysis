# Overview

Welcome to my analysis of the data job market, focusing on data analyst roles. This project was created out of a desire to navigate and understand the job market more effectively. It delves into the top-paying and in-demand skills to help find optimal job opportunities for data analysts.

The data sourced from [Luke Barousse's Python Course](https://lukebarousse.com/python) which provides a foundation for my analysis, containing detailed information on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills. Through a series of Python scripts, I explore key questions such as the most demanded skills, salary trends, and the intersection of demand and salary in data analytics.

# The Questions

Below are the questions I want to answer in my project:

1. What are the skills most in demand for the top 3 most popular data roles?
2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?
3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?
4. What are the optimal skills for data analysts to learn? (High Demand AND High Paying) 

# Tools I Used

For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **Python:** allowing me to analyze the data and find critical insights. I also used the following Python libraries:
    - **Pandas Library:** This was used to analyze the data. 
    - **Matplotlib Library:** I visualized the data.
    - **Seaborn Library:** Helped me create more advanced visuals. 
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** The tool I used to run my Python scripts which let me easily include my notes and analysis.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for executing my Python scripts.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my Python code and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# Data Preparation and Cleanup
This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.
I start by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset, followed by initial data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality.

```
# Importing Libraries
import ast
import pandas as pd
from datasets import load_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import seaborn as sns
# import openpyxl

# Loading Data
dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

# Data Cleanup
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
# Job skills to list 
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)
```

# The Analysis

# What I Learned

Throughout this project, I deepened my understanding of the data analyst job market and enhanced my technical skills in Python, especially in data manipulation and visualization. Here are a few specific things I learned:

- **Advanced Python Usage**: Utilizing libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization, and other libraries helped me perform complex data analysis tasks more efficiently.
- **Data Cleaning Importance**: I learned that thorough data cleaning and preparation are crucial before any analysis can be conducted, ensuring the accuracy of insights derived from the data.
- **Strategic Skill Analysis**: The project emphasized the importance of aligning one's skills with market demand. Understanding the relationship between skill demand, salary, and job availability allows for more strategic career planning in the tech industry.


# Insights

This project provided several general insights into the data job market for analysts:

- **Skill Demand and Salary Correlation**: There is a clear correlation between the demand for specific skills and the salaries these skills command. Advanced and specialized skills like Python and Oracle often lead to higher salaries.
- **Market Trends**: There are changing trends in skill demand, highlighting the dynamic nature of the data job market. Keeping up with these trends is essential for career growth in data analytics.
- **Economic Value of Skills**: Understanding which skills are both in-demand and well-compensated can guide data analysts in prioritizing learning to maximize their economic returns.


# Challenges I Faced

This project was not without its challenges, but it provided good learning opportunities:

- **Data Inconsistencies**: Handling missing or inconsistent data entries requires careful consideration and thorough data-cleaning techniques to ensure the integrity of the analysis.
- **Complex Data Visualization**: Designing effective visual representations of complex datasets was challenging but critical for conveying insights clearly and compellingly.
- **Balancing Breadth and Depth**: Deciding how deeply to dive into each analysis while maintaining a broad overview of the data landscape required constant balancing to ensure comprehensive coverage without getting lost in details.


# Conclusion

This exploration into the data analyst job market has been incredibly informative, highlighting the critical skills and trends that shape this evolving field. The insights I got enhance my understanding and provide actionable guidance for anyone looking to advance their career in data analytics. As the market continues to change, ongoing analysis will be essential to stay ahead in data analytics. This project is a good foundation for future explorations and underscores the importance of continuous learning and adaptation in the data field.
